## Problem

SPEC-002 AC-010 mandates `feat/spec-NNN` as the *only* merge target with direct task PRs to main forbidden — a hard rule. The SPEC-001/SPEC-002 bootstrap dispatch violated this rule pragmatically (10 task PRs went direct to main), and nothing broke. The bootstrap had clean per-task file boundaries, no atomic-deploy requirements, and the orchestrator (Claude with full context) made a sensible judgment call.

The user surfaced this directly: "I've found it very helpful to create a feature branch for a given spec so that all tasks for that spec get merged to that branch and only when it's completed, does the spec branch get merged. This helps with managing breaking changes, but I can also see it being overkill in some instances."

The hard rule is wrong in both directions:
- **Too strict for small specs.** Bootstrapping `feat/spec-NNN`, opening N task PRs against it, then opening an integration PR adds ceremony with no payoff when tasks are independent additions with clean boundaries.
- **Right for risky specs.** When tasks must land together (breaking changes, multi-workspace atomic deploys, cross-cutting refactors), the integration branch is real safety — partial deploys would break intermediate states.

The right shape is conditional: explicit author control with a sensible heuristic default.

### Reframing in iter-2: extending SPEC-002, not amending it

Iter-1 review flagged that "amend SPEC-002 to v2" violates `spec-schema.md`'s transition rules (no `completed → active` step). SPEC-002 is `status: completed`. This spec adopts the same pattern SPEC-004 introduced (per iter-1 cross-cutting insight): **completed specs are immutable**; the live artifacts (`spec-execution/SKILL.md`, `spec-schema.md`, `review-primitives.md`) get extended in place, and the completed spec gets a Changelog annotation pointing at the extension.

This spec extends `spec-execution/SKILL.md`'s integration-branch behavior to be conditional. SPEC-002 stays `status: completed v1` with a Changelog v1.1 entry. The AC-010 wording in SPEC-002 itself is not edited — it remains the historical record of what the spec said at completion time. The live skill behavior is what consumers actually invoke.

## Success criteria

- [ ] Spec frontmatter accepts an optional `integration_strategy: branch | direct` field. When set, `spec-execution` uses it verbatim.
- [ ] When the field is unset, `spec-execution` computes the strategy from observable spec properties via a documented heuristic (default direction errs toward `branch` for risky shapes, `direct` for small clean specs).
- [ ] `spec-execution` Phase 1 records the resolved strategy in the telemetry log (new event type) so the decision is auditable.
- [ ] On the first spec executed under the updated `spec-execution`, the strategy decision matches the owner's pre-registered expectation (see AC-009 for the protocol).
- [ ] SPEC-002 v1 stays `status: completed` and unchanged in its design body. A Changelog v1.1 entry on SPEC-002 documents the extension and points at SPEC-005.

## Scope

### In scope

- `spec-schema.md` extension: add optional `integration_strategy: branch | direct` field. Schema validation accepts unset or either of the two valid values.
- `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` extension:
  - Phase 1: new "resolve integration strategy" step after `status: active` verification, before branch creation.
  - Phase 2: per-task lifecycle parameterized by resolved strategy.
  - Phase 3: integration PR only in `branch` mode; in `direct` mode, spec-completion fires on the last task PR's merge.
  - Telemetry: new `integration_strategy_resolved` event type added to the schema; the worked example log fixture (`.ai/skills/spec-execution/examples/example-execution.log.jsonl`, which exists post-TASK-010) gains one such event at the start.
- Document the heuristic in one authoritative location: `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 1 step "resolve integration strategy". `spec-schema.md` and SPEC-002's Changelog annotation reference this single source.
- Changelog v1.1 annotation on SPEC-002 per the "completed specs are immutable" pattern (same convention introduced by SPEC-004).

### Out of scope

- **`spec-amendment` skill behavior changes for integration-strategy-aware amendments.** Removed from this spec per iter-1 F-003 (was AC-010 originally; it implied skill changes not enumerated in scope). Captured in intents.md as a follow-up.
- **Automated detection of "breaking" from code analysis.** The `breaking` tag is author-asserted via spec tags.
- **Mid-execution strategy switching.** The orchestrator commits to one strategy at Phase 1; cannot switch mid-execution.
- **Retroactive application to in-flight specs.** Specs already executing under the old behavior finish under the old rules.
- **Formal `completed → amendable` spec-schema transition.** This spec uses the extension pattern; formalization captured in intents.md.

## Design

### Strategy resolution algorithm (canonical source)

The orchestrator resolves the strategy at Phase 1 step 1 (right after verifying `status: active`). The pseudocode here is the design-time source. **Once `spec-execution/SKILL.md` is updated, the SKILL is canonical and any divergence is a contract violation.**

```python
def resolve_integration_strategy(spec):
    # 1. Explicit field wins.
    if spec.frontmatter.get("integration_strategy") in ("branch", "direct"):
        return spec.frontmatter["integration_strategy"], "explicit"

    # 2. Heuristic fallback.
    task_count = len(spec.tasks)
    workspaces = spec.frontmatter.get("workspaces") or []
    tags = spec.frontmatter.get("tags") or []
    cross_workspace_blocks = any_cross_workspace_blocks(spec.tasks)

    if ("breaking" in tags
        or len(workspaces) > 1
        or task_count >= 5
        or cross_workspace_blocks):
        return "branch", "heuristic"
    return "direct", "heuristic"

def any_cross_workspace_blocks(tasks):
    """True iff some task T has a non-empty blocks entry pointing at task U
    such that T.workspace != U.workspace AND both fields are non-empty.
    If either workspace is missing on T or U, that pair does NOT count."""
    by_id = {t.id: t for t in tasks}
    for t in tasks:
        if not t.workspace:
            continue
        for u_id in (t.blocks or []):
            u = by_id.get(u_id)
            if u and u.workspace and u.workspace != t.workspace:
                return True
    return False
```

**Why these signals:**
- `breaking` tag → explicit author signal that partial deploy would harm consumers.
- `len(workspaces) > 1` → multi-workspace spec needs coordinated landing.
- `task_count >= 5` → bookkeeping overhead of a feature branch amortizes when there are ≥5 PRs.
- `cross_workspace_blocks` → producer-consumer contract crosses workspaces; verify contract in one place before main.

### Strategy semantics

**`branch` mode (existing behavior, unchanged):**
- Phase 1: create `feat/spec-NNN` off main.
- Phase 2: each task PR targets `feat/spec-NNN`. Let `target_branch = "feat/" + spec.id`.
- Phase 3: open integration PR `feat/spec-NNN → main` after all tasks done. Then invoke `spec-completion` against the integration PR's diff. On integration PR merge, archive the execution log alongside the spec.

**`direct` mode (new):**
- Phase 1: no integration branch created. The resolved strategy + signals event is logged.
- Phase 2: each task PR targets `main` directly. Let `target_branch = "main"`. The variable name `target_branch` is the canonical identifier — the spec-execution Appendix B pseudocode uses it.
- Phase 3 (anchored to concrete events):
  - When all tasks reach a **terminal state** (`done` or `cancelled`) — the same all-tasks-terminal trigger SPEC-002 Phase 2 step 4 already defines — the orchestrator checks: if at least one task merged (status `done`), invoke `spec-completion` against the current `main` HEAD as the comparison baseline. If all tasks are `cancelled`, do NOT invoke `spec-completion` (mirroring `branch` mode where an all-cancelled spec does not open an integration PR); proceed directly to the archive step.
  - On `spec-completion`'s `accept` return (or owner sign-off in the spec-side flow), archive the execution log to `specs/tasks/SPEC-NNN/_execution.log.jsonl`. "Archive" here means "no further events appended; append a final sentinel comment line `# spec_completed: <iso8601>` at the end of the file." The sentinel is a comment (lines starting with `#` are JSONL convention for human-readable markers; JSONL parsers ignore them) — NOT a new telemetry event. The live `spec-execution/SKILL.md` telemetry schema therefore stays at 10 event types (the 9 existing + `integration_strategy_resolved`); no `spec_completed` event is introduced. No integration PR exists; no integration-PR-merge event to trigger off.

### Telemetry extension

Phase 1 emits a new event recording the resolved strategy. **This is added to the live `spec-execution/SKILL.md` telemetry schema list** (SPEC-002's telemetry schema in its spec body remains historical at 9 event types; the live skill list grows to 10 — per the "extend live artifacts, not completed specs" pattern):

```json
{"ts": "<iso8601>", "spec": "SPEC-NNN", "event": "integration_strategy_resolved", "strategy": "branch | direct", "source": "explicit | heuristic", "signals": {"breaking_tag": <bool>, "workspace_count": <int>, "task_count": <int>, "cross_workspace_blocks": <bool>}}
```

The worked example log fixture at `.ai/skills/spec-execution/examples/example-execution.log.jsonl` (created by TASK-010 and now live in main) gains this event at the start.

### `direct`-mode Phase 3 trigger detection

The orchestrator monitors task PRs in `direct` mode the same way it monitors them in `branch` mode (the task-status flip from `in-progress` to `done` is the same event in both modes). The only difference is the post-`done` trigger:

- `branch` mode: when all tasks reach `done`, open integration PR.
- `direct` mode: when all tasks reach `done`, invoke `spec-completion` directly (no PR to open).

This is documented in `spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 3 as two branches off the same trigger ("all tasks terminal").

### Pre-registered strategy for AC-009

To make the "matches owner's intent" success criterion measurable WITHOUT touching `spec-schema.md`: before dispatching a spec under the updated orchestrator, the owner records the expected strategy in a sidecar file `specs/tasks/SPEC-NNN/_expected_strategy` containing exactly one line: `branch` or `direct`. The sidecar is outside `spec-schema.md`'s frontmatter validation surface, so no schema change is required to support it. After Phase 1 resolves, AC-009 compares the resolved strategy (from the `integration_strategy_resolved` event) to the contents of the sidecar. Match = pass. Mismatch = the owner either overrides (sets `integration_strategy:` explicitly in the spec frontmatter for the next dispatch) or accepts the heuristic's call. The sidecar file is deleted by the orchestrator immediately after logging the comparison result to the deferred-verifications table (per AC-009), in a follow-up commit on the spec's branch.

### Changelog annotation on SPEC-002

SPEC-002 gains a `## Changelog` section per the convention introduced by SPEC-004:

```markdown
## Changelog

### v1 (2026-05-18) — initial
- Initial spec, completed 2026-05-18.

### v1.1 (2026-05-XX) — extensions via SPEC-005
- SPEC-005 added the following without modifying this spec's contracts:
  - Conditional integration-branch strategy in spec-execution: optional
    `integration_strategy: branch | direct` field with heuristic fallback.
  - `integration_strategy_resolved` event added to the live telemetry schema
    (10 event types in the skill; this spec's body documents 9).
- AC-010 of this spec (mandating `feat/spec-NNN` as ONLY merge pattern) is
  superseded in the live behavior by SPEC-005's conditional resolution.
  AC-010's wording in this spec body is preserved as historical record.
- See SPEC-005 for the rationale, heuristic, and full design.
```

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AC-001 — `spec-schema.md` declares `integration_strategy` as an optional frontmatter field with allowed values `branch` and `direct`. Validation accepts unset, `branch`, or `direct`; any other value fails validation.
- [ ] AC-002 — `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 1 includes a "resolve integration strategy" step that runs after `status: active` verification and before integration-branch creation. The step contains the `resolve_integration_strategy` and `any_cross_workspace_blocks` pseudocode from Design > Strategy resolution algorithm verbatim.
- [ ] AC-003 — When `integration_strategy` is set explicitly in the spec frontmatter, the orchestrator uses that value without invoking the heuristic. Verified by inspection of the `integration_strategy_resolved` telemetry event (`source: "explicit"`).
- [ ] AC-004 — When `integration_strategy` is unset, the orchestrator computes the strategy per the heuristic. Each of the four signals independently triggers `branch`; the absence of all four triggers `direct`. **Verification deliverable:** `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 1 worked-example section enumerates 5 cases (4 signals × 1 trigger each, plus the all-false → `direct` case) showing input spec shape and expected resolved strategy.
- [ ] AC-005 — `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 2 describes both flows. The per-task lifecycle pseudocode in Appendix B uses a `target_branch` variable resolved from the strategy: `target_branch = "feat/" + spec.id` in `branch` mode; `target_branch = "main"` in `direct` mode. The variable name `target_branch` is the canonical identifier.
- [ ] AC-006 — `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` Phase 3 describes both flows with explicit event anchors per Design > Strategy semantics. `branch` mode: integration PR opened after all tasks terminal (`done` or `cancelled`), then spec-completion if at least one task merged. `direct` mode: when all tasks reach terminal state, if at least one task is `done` invoke spec-completion against `main` HEAD; if all tasks are `cancelled` skip spec-completion (mirroring `branch` mode's all-cancelled behavior). Archive step appends a sentinel comment line `# spec_completed: <iso8601>` to `_execution.log.jsonl` — not a new event type; the live schema stays at 10 events.
- [ ] AC-007 — `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` telemetry schema gains the `integration_strategy_resolved` event with the fields per Design > Telemetry extension. The live worked example log fixture (`.ai/skills/spec-execution/examples/example-execution.log.jsonl`) is updated to include this event at the start.
- [ ] AC-008 — SPEC-002 gains a `## Changelog` section per Design > Changelog annotation on SPEC-002. The annotation is a v1.1 entry; SPEC-002 frontmatter `status: completed` and `version: 1` are unchanged. The body of SPEC-002 (including AC-010's original wording) is unchanged.
- [ ] AC-009 — On the first spec executed under the updated orchestrator, the owner records the expected strategy in a sidecar file `specs/tasks/SPEC-NNN/_expected_strategy` (single line: `branch` or `direct`) BEFORE dispatch. After Phase 1 resolves, the orchestrator compares the resolved strategy (from the `integration_strategy_resolved` event) to the sidecar content. The orchestrator records the result (match/mismatch + values) in the spec-completion deferred-verifications table per SPEC-004 Design > 3, with Owner: spec owner; Trigger: first spec executed under updated orchestrator; Method: read sidecar, read `integration_strategy_resolved.strategy` from `_execution.log.jsonl`, compare. The orchestrator deletes the sidecar in a follow-up commit immediately after recording the comparison.
- [ ] AC-010 — When the live `spec-execution/SKILL.md` is reverted to its pre-SPEC-005 state: in-flight orchestrator processes (those that were dispatched and are still running) are **unaffected by the revert** — they hold the pre-revert skill version in memory and continue under it until their wave loop terminates naturally; the revert only affects orchestrator processes started after the revert lands. For specs that were dispatched in `direct` mode and are still in flight at revert time, their task PRs continue merging to `main` until all tasks reach terminal state. Newly-started orchestrator processes (post-revert) that encounter a spec with `integration_strategy: direct` in frontmatter will fail at Phase 1 with the unrecognized-field error — the recovery path is to simultaneously revert `spec-schema.md` to strip the field, treating future spec drafts as if the field were never introduced. The example log fixture `.ai/skills/spec-execution/examples/example-execution.log.jsonl` is also reverted (the `integration_strategy_resolved` event removed) so it matches the reverted schema.

## Risks & constraints

- **Heuristic miscalibration.** Four signals may misjudge edge cases. Mitigation: explicit field always wins; AC-009 measurement protocol catches misalignment on first use.
- **`breaking` tag is informal.** No enforcement that authors apply it correctly. Mitigation: convention only; rely on author discipline. Captured as a future intent for stricter detection.
- **`cross_workspace_blocks` requires reading all task files** — O(N_tasks × N_blocks). Fine for typical specs (≤30 tasks). The predicate is precisely defined in Design > Strategy resolution algorithm (only counts when both workspaces are non-empty and differ).
- **In-flight specs grandfather under old rule.** Specs that started under SPEC-002's branch-only behavior finish under that behavior even after this spec's live changes land. Mitigation: documented in Migration; consumers can see which behavior applied by reading the `integration_strategy_resolved` event (or its absence — pre-SPEC-005 dispatches have no such event).
- **`direct` mode loses the "all of spec lands together" guarantee** — but that's the whole point. Partial-merged specs are a real intermediate state in `direct` mode. Mitigation: heuristic catches the high-risk cases; explicit author control catches the rest. The owner pre-registration in AC-009 is the validation that the heuristic chose right on the first real use.
- **SPEC-002 is `status: completed`.** This spec extends its behavior without amending it — using the "extend live artifacts; annotate completed specs in Changelog" pattern introduced by SPEC-004. Mitigation: AC-008 enforces the unchanged status / version / body. The convention is also a deferred intent for future schema formalization.
- **Direct-mode rollback semantics** (AC-010): in-flight orchestrators are unaffected (continue under pre-revert behavior); newly-started orchestrators post-revert require simultaneous `spec-schema.md` revert. Documented explicitly.
- **`integration_strategy_resolved` event** is the only new telemetry event; SPEC-002's telemetry schema in its body remains at 9 events as a historical record (per the extension pattern); the live `spec-execution/SKILL.md` schema grows to 10 events.

## Migration

### Current state

- SPEC-002 AC-010 hard-requires integration-branch pattern (historical record).
- `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` implements only the `branch` flow.
- `spec-schema.md` has no `integration_strategy` field.
- SPEC-002 has no Changelog section.

### Target state

- `spec-schema.md` declares the optional field.
- `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` implements both flows behind the single resolution algorithm.
- Live telemetry schema (in the skill) records the resolved strategy on every execution.
- SPEC-002 has a Changelog v1.1 annotation pointing at SPEC-005.

### Migration strategy

1. Land the `spec-schema.md` extension (AC-001) — additive, no runtime impact.
2. Land the `.ai/skills/spec-execution/SKILL.md` extension (AC-002 through AC-007, AC-010) — the runtime change. Updates Phase 1, Phase 2 (pseudocode), Phase 3, telemetry schema list, and the worked example fixture.
3. Land the Changelog annotation on SPEC-002 (AC-008) — last, since it references the live changes that just landed.
4. Validate on the first spec executed under the updated orchestrator (AC-009).

### Rollback plan

- Each piece is independently revertable.
- The schema addition is additive (specs without the field still validate).
- Reverting `spec-execution/SKILL.md` restores `branch`-only behavior. **In-flight orchestrators are unaffected** — they hold the pre-revert skill version in memory and continue under it. Only newly-started orchestrators see the reverted behavior. The reverted orchestrator will fail at Phase 1 for any spec with `integration_strategy: direct` in frontmatter — the recovery path is to simultaneously strip the field from `spec-schema.md` so future spec drafts don't include it. The worked example log fixture `.ai/skills/spec-execution/examples/example-execution.log.jsonl` must also be reverted to remove the `integration_strategy_resolved` event so it stays consistent with the reverted schema.
- SPEC-002 Changelog annotation is revertable text deletion — no contract impact.
